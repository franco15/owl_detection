example: python prepare_to_dream_with_owls_2nite.py /Users/owl/goinfre/owl_pics/burrow_86/F1-86-2017-06-30/ batch27 0

gonna have to double check once images are sorted owl not owl

need to contact owl guy to get criteria on deciding if owl or not owl

manual clasific8or aka prepare_to_dream_with_owls_2nite:
	if you wrongly classific8 an image hit escape to exit program,
	go to the csv file and delete the row(s) you believe are wrongly classified,
	last argument = last row of the csv file
	something like that

check last photos of F1-86-2017-06-12, is there an owl inside the trap??

skipped directories:
	F1-86-2017-05-23\ to\ 05-25/

F1-86-2017-06-14a/EK000763.JPG: "Premature end of JPEG file"




to use gpu to run keras program:
	THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python your_net.py






another_train.py:
	need labels for training, mnist ex. For example,
		3 would be [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Consequently, mnist.train.labels is
		a [55000, 10] array of floats.

	does the dtype of the images converted to numpy arrays matter??
		mnist images are dtype=float32
